# SampleGame
sample card game


Im completely new to this. I created a boardgame over the course of 4 years and have been working spuratically for the past 5 trying to
find a way to actually code this game myself. I have gotten very close, but still lack the understanding to put all my knowledge together
to actually get the game to function coherently. So if you stumble upon this and have any interests or advice, feel free to let me know.


Assumed Game components (I will try to continually update this)
